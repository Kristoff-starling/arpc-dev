## ðŸ›  Running the Transparent UDP Proxy


### 1.  Build and Run the Proxy

First, build the binary and run it under a dedicated user (e.g., `proxyuser`) to avoid redirect loops:

```bash
go build -o myproxy main.go
sudo -u proxyuser ./myproxy
```

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure `proxyuser` exists:
>
> ```bash
> sudo useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin proxyuser
> ```

---

### 2. Set Up `iptables` Rules

To transparently intercept both directions of UDP communication:

```bash
# Intercept server â†’ client responses (PREROUTING for incoming packets)
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --sport 9000 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 15002

# Intercept client â†’ server requests (OUTPUT for local packets)
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 9000 -m owner ! --uid-owner proxyuser -j REDIRECT --to-ports 15002
```

These rules ensure:

* Packets from the **frontend to the server** are redirected to the proxy (except those sent by the proxy itself).
* Packets from the **server to the frontend** are also redirected to the proxy before reaching the frontend.

---

### 3. Confirm Rules Are Installed

Run the following to verify the rules are active and matching packets:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v
```

You should see non-zero packet and byte counts for the two rules after sending traffic.

---

### 4. Resetting Rules (Cleanup)

To remove the rules if needed:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p udp --sport 9000 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 15002
sudo iptables -t nat -D OUTPUT -p udp --dport 9000 -m owner ! --uid-owner proxyuser -j REDIRECT --to-ports 15002
```
